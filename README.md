Project Overview

The aim of this study is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 flu vaccine. We believe the prediction outputs (model and analysis) of this study will give public health professionals and policy makers, as an end user, a clear understanding of factors associated with low vaccination rates. This in turn, enables end users to systematically act on those features hindering people to get vaccinated.

Model Used:
RandomForestClassifier

Since it is a multilabel problem I have used OneVsRestClassifier from sklearn.multiclass
